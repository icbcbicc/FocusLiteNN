**[Update Feb. 1, 2023]**
An online demo can be founed at [CODIDO](https://www.codido.co/marketplace/browse2?ecr_repo=gAAAAABj2sqyCrxcrHosuKPPC-HAuQTf-puIHz8IeXBqxGliX_lTsn3puU7XJxSdKzLq-cf7XK9zFJt-m0yfXBbecHWEQibYZGfun5UpAQH_466Ej4W_eC1HC20XTBeDS8zcGxL7rk4T). You can easily try our model with a few mouse clicks. These demo models are trained using the MSE loss.

**[Update Jan. 31, 2023]**
The original loss used for training all models in the paper is PLCC, which doesn't produce absolute scale scores. This update features three FocusLiteNN (1-kernel, 2-kernel, 10-kernel) models trained with the **MSE loss** using the entire FocusPath dataset, which produce **absolute scale scores**. This is beneficial for **single image testing** and **heatmap visualization**. The pre-trained models are located at `pretrained_model/focuslitenn-{1,2,10}kernel-mse.pt`.

### 1. Brief Introduction

#### 1.1 Backgrounds

- **Out-of-focus microscopy lens** in digital pathology is a **critical bottleneck** in high-throughput Whole Slide Image scanning platforms, for which Focus Quality Assessment methods are highly desirable to help significantly accelerate the clinical workflows.
- While **data-driven approaches** such as Convolutional Neural Network based methods have shown great promises, they are difficult to use in practice due to their **high computational complexity**.

#### 1.2 Contributions

- We propose a **highly efficient** CNN-based model FocusLiteNN that only has **148 paramters** for Focus Quality Assessment. It maintains impressive performance and is **100x faster** than ResNet50.
- We introduce a **comprehensive annotated dataset** [TCGA@Focus](https://zenodo.org/record/3910757#.Xve1MXX0kUe), which contains 14371 pathological images with in/out focus labels.

#### 1.3 Results

- Evaluation results on the proposed [TCGA@Focus](https://zenodo.org/record/3910757#.Xve1MXX0kUe) dataset

- Our proposed FocusLiteNN (1-kernel) model is highly efficient.
